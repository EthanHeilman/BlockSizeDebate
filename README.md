# BlockSizeDebate


Argument1 Pro: Increased Transaction Throughput
=========

The chief argument for the increase in blocksize is to raise the total throughput of the Bitcoin network from its current ~3 tps. This is most often attributed to an expected spike in adoption.

  ### Counter Argument1.1: Other Scaling Solutions
  
  **1.1a Off-Chain Third Parties**<a name="Offchain"> </a>
  
  Of the listed solutions, this is the only one implemented today. These would significanly cut down on block size by making the minimal number of transactions, and by condensing the number of inputs/outputs used.
  
    *1.1a.1 Security Concerns*
    
    Opening up to third parties allows them to steal from you, and have your funds more easily hacked.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> 
    
    *1.1a.2 Privacy Concerns*
    
    This allows for third parties to more easily collect information on you, and leak<sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> it. Not only does this open up Bitcoin to regulatory bodies, but also hackers.
  
  **1.1b Lightning Networks/StrawPay**
  
  Each of these are decentralized versions of the above, designed to reduce the amount of trust needed. Using payment channels allows it to use much less room on the blockchain, however, leading to a higher overall transaction rate.
  
    *1.1b.1 Security Concerns*
    
    Like with [Off-Chain Third Parties](#Offchain), there are often security concerns sited, such as the ability to steal other parties' funds.<sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup>
